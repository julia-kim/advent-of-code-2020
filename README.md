[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) is an initiative by [Eric Wastl](http://was.tl/) that consists of a series of 25 (2-part) puzzles released daily at midnight EST/UTC-5 between the 1st and 25th of December. These small programming puzzles are intended "for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like."
  
Here are my amateurish attempts at solving these puzzles in Java.
